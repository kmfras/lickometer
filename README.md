# lickometer
description of an open-source arduino-controlled lickometer system for the investigation of reward consumption in neuroscience research. 


Included are the associated arduino control code and example MATLAB analysis code for the extraction of data and 
microstructural analysis of rodent fluid consumption


This project is a cost-effective solution to the recording of licking during the consumption of liquid rewards.
